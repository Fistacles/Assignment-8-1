1) To summarize the project, Project Two required us to create two tables that showed what a customer of the bank's interest would be both with 
an additional deposit each month and without. It allowed the user to decide how many years would be looked at, the initial amount, the rate,
and the monhtly deposit amount.

2) I feel that I made the code particularly easy to parse. There is little clutter and the functions are in a logical order that lets someone who
Is reading the code easily interpret it.

3) To improve the code I worked harder on input validation. I did very little to try and incorporate that into my code.

4) The most challenging part of the code was actually beginning to write it. I had a great deal of difficulty trying to create the pseudocode to begin
the project. Once I did that, beyond a bit of trouble shooting, it was straightforward if lengthy work.

5) The skills that I can take from this project to other would be how to separate files to keep the code clean, and how to properly use functions
to split apart the various aspects and processes I need to properly utilize my code.

6) I made this program maintainable and readable by keeping the functions in a logical order like keeping setters and getters near each other, and 
keeping the various functions in a logical and straightforward order rather than having them in a random order.
